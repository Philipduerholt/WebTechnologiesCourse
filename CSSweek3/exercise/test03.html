<h1>EARLY ENGLISH LAWS</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <b>Early English Text Society</b> (EETS) was founded in 1864 by Frederick James Furnivall, with the help of Richard Morris, Walter Skeat, and others, to bring the mass of unprinted Early English literature within the reach of students and to provide sound texts from which the NED, New English Dictionary (subsequently the OED, Oxford English Dictionary) could quote. It has continued to publish medieval English texts ever since, currently producing one or two titles a year in the Original Series and on occasion additional titles in its Supplementary Series. Most of the past publications are kept in print, though in some cases older editions have been replaced by newer ones.</p>
