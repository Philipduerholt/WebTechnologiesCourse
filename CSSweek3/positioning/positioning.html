	RuPaul Andre Charles (born November 17, 1960), best known mononymously as RuPaul, is an American actor,
	drag queen, model, author, and recording artist. RuPaul was born and raised in San Diego and later moved
	to Atlanta to study performing arts. He settled in New York City where he became a popular fixture on the nightclub scene.

RuPaul achieved international fame as a drag queen with the hit song "Supermodel (You Better Work)" from his album Supermodel
 of the World (1993) and later dueted with Elton John on the song "Don't Go Breaking My Heart". In 1996, he became a spokesperson
 for MAC Cosmetics, raising money for the Mac AIDS Fund and becoming the first drag queen supermodel. The same year, he landed his
 own talk show The RuPaul Show which ran for two years on VH1 before co-hosting the morning radio show on WKTU with Michelle Visage.
 He has since released the albums Foxy Lady (1996), Ho, Ho, Ho (1997), Red Hot (2004), Champion (2009), Glamazon (2011), Born Naked
 (2014) and Realness (2015) and made appearances in films including Crooklyn (1994), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), To Wong Foo,
 Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995) and But I'm a Cheerleader (1999). RuPaul has also published two books: Lettin' 
 It All Hang Out (1995) and Workin' It (2010). His reality television series RuPaul's Drag Race, which follows RuPaul in his search
 for the next drag superstar, has produced seven series on LGBT network Logo TV. He is also a host on television shows Skin Wars and Good Work.

RuPaul is noted among drag queens for his indifference toward the gender-specific pronouns used to address him—both "he" and "she"
 have been deemed acceptable, as stated in his autobiography: "You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee;
 I don't care! Just as long as you call me."[2] RuPaul has also played men in a number of roles, and makes public appearances both in and out of drag.
 In 1999, RuPaul was awarded the Vito Russo Award at the GLAAD Media Awards in addition to being honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by The Most
 Beautiful Transsexuals in the World Association in 2002.
