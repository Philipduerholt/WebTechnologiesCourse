	<h1>Mapping Medieval Chester: place and identity in an English borderland city c.1200-1500</h1>	

	<p>
	This AHRC-funded research project brings together a team including literary specialists,
	historical geographers and historians to explore space, place and identity in medieval Chester.
	The project asks questions about Chester as a city on the (often troubled) border between England
	and Wales, and about how different medieval inhabitants imagined and represented the urban space
	around them.
