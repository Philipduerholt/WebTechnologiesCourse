	<h1>About the project</h1>	

	<p>
	This project brings together scholars working in the disciplines of literary studies,
	geography, archaeology and history to explore how material and imagined urban landscapes
	construct and convey a sense of place-identity. The focus of the project is the city of
	Chester and the identities that its inhabitants formed between c.1200 and 1500. A key aspect
	of the project is to integrate geographical and literary mappings of the medieval city using
	cartographic and textual sources and using these to understand more how urban landscapes in
	the Middle Ages were interpreted and navigated by local inhabitants. One particularly innovative
	dimension of this is the project's use of information technologies both as a means of exploring
	these 'mappings' of medieval Chester, for example through the use and development of a Geographical
	Information System (GIS) to create a map of Chester as it was c.1500, and as a means of widening
	access and public interest in Chester's medieval past and in medieval urban studies generally by
	linking literary and cartographic sources in digital media. The project will thus not only extend
	our understanding of how placed-identities were forged in the medieval city through local association
	and relationships with imagined and material urban landscapes, but also foster transferable methodologies
	and working models for integrating visual and textual digital data sources in humanities computing
	projects.

	There are three key research questions guiding the project's research objectives:
	</p>
	
	<ol>
	
	<li>1.	How do different kinds of literary and geographical 'mappings' of medieval Chester
	(cartographic, textual) relate to each other?</li>
	
	<li>2.	How was Chester's urban landscape interpreted by those writing of the city and its environs
	during the Middle Ages?</li>
	
	<li>3.	How was the place of Chester as a multicultural city on the border of England and Wales
	manifested in the formation of local identities through perceptions of its landscape, environment,
	and history?</li>
	
	</ol>
