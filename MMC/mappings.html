	<h1>Mappings</h1>	

	<p>
	One of the main aims of this project is to reflect upon different 'mappings' of late-medieval Chester. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	To explore this, two mapping exercises are currently in progress, one involving the creation of
	a map which shows Chester in around 1500, shortly before the time of the Reformation, and a second
	examining contemporary medieval texts that relate to the medieval city. These texts include the
	Middle English verse Life of St Werburgh by Henry Bradshaw (c. 1513), Lucianâ€™s Latin De Laude Cestrie
	(In Praise of Chester) (c. 1195) and a selection of medieval Welsh poems which relate to Chester.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The two 'mappings' are currently at an early stage, but to give a visual impression
	of how the project is trying to relate its modern map-making exercise with the textual
	mappings of medieval Chester, the following page deliberately juxtaposes map-images of Chester
	against selected extracts from Henry Bradshaw, Lucian and a late-medieval Welsh poem.
